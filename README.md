# ARYON


- Clone the repository and change directory to the `aryon` folder. Then run the command below to install all dependencies:
```js
yarn install
```
- Check the mock-server folder, the instruction to run the server is in the `README.md`. 

- Once the server has started, you can go back the root folder of the aryon folder,
create a `.env` file, add `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001` and run:

```js
yarn dev
```

- To run the test with coverage, run the command: 

```js
yarn test
```

- NB: The filtering feature wasn't implemented as at this time.
